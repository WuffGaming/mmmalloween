:dad:I feel like the only reason why you are forcing us to rap battle is because of your own benefit.
:dad:The benefit of being better than the others, the feeling that you will never have in your sad pathetic life.
:dad:Sheâ€™s probably fucking another dude right now, you will never live up to her expectations.
:dad:The only reason why you are rap battling is to not feel hollow within yourself, which even then is not helping with anything, is it?
:dad:You live day in and day out being sought out by your girlfriends parents and almost being murdered by them, you live a sad life and it will never get better.
:dad:You are not a good person and never will be, rap battling others for your own personal benefit to fix your petty little life, fuck you.
